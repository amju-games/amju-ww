This game was originally called Amju Wibble Wobble, which is why this repo is called amju-ww, and there are some other references to 'WW' in the code.

## Building and running on Windows

1. This game depends on amjulib, which is my game engine library. You need to clone amju-ww and amjulib into the same dir, e.g.:
