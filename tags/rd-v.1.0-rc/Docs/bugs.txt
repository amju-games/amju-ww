Loading config file - fails on new install, should be silent as not a problem.
Do we need to load at all? We have ROConfig...
YES - it's for writable config like screen size


Levels
======

All objs need UV mapping and materials

More sound FX 


Game play
=========


amjulib
=======
Title bar in Dialogs, show title, allow drag

File dialog :- dir contents disappears when you type a filename. Should only 
 refresh contents for a path with no filename suffixed?

GUI Manager 
 - sends events to all active GUIs - is the only GUI event handler
 - handles KB for text entry
 - Tooltips
 - Active default button/element
 - (Makes sure Cursor drawn last?)

Edit mode
=========

Crashes in file save dialogs

Crash after run/stop
 - This is Lurk msgs - ptr to deleted GUI object maybe?
 - OK now it seems - Updated Luker

Stop does not reset positions
 - Implement Reset() in all types
 - OK

Can't duplicate
 - Needs AddToGame, replacing AddSceneNode

Can't delete

Can't set properties - need something like AntTweakBar

Moving objects is too sensitive - use camera to work out how far mouse 
  has moved in world coords

Low priority
------------
Initial camera pos should point at player 1

Show filename and if any unsaved changes

Disable (grey out) Undo/Redo

Keyboard shortcuts
